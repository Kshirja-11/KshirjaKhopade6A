<H3> <b> <u> GSAT –Communication Satellites  </H3></b></u>
 <P>The GSAT series of geosynchronous satellites is a system developed by ISRO with an objective to make India self-reliant in broadcasting services.  </P>
 <P>The system includes a total of 168 transponders (out of which 95 are leased out to provide services to broadcasters) in the C,
 Extended C and Ku bands, providing services to telecommunications, television broadcasting, weather forecasting, disaster warning and search and rescue operations. </P>
 <P>The GSAT (Geosynchronous Satellite) satellites are India's developed communications satellites, used for digital audio, data and video broadcasting. </P>
 	<P>The GSAT-20, also known as GSAT-N2, is India's most advanced communication satellite to date. Weighing 4,700 kg,
 it carries a high-throughput Ka-band payload capable of delivering 48 Gbps of data transmission capacity </P>

<H3> <b> <u>  Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC)  </H3></b></u>
<P> To meet the positioning, navigation and timing requirements of the nation, 
ISRO has established a regional navigation satellite system called Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC). </P> 
<P> NavIC was erstwhile known as Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).</P>
<P>NavIC SPS signals are interoperable with the other global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals namely 
GPS, Glonass, Galileo and BeiDou) and timing accuracy better than 50ns (2NavIC offers two services: Standard Position Service (SPS) for civilian users 
and Restricted Service (RS) for strategic users. </P>
<P>NavIC coverage area includes India and a region up to 1500 km beyond Indian boundary. </P>
<P>NavIC signals are designed to provide user position accurately </P>
